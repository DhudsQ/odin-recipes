    <h2>Story of the french toast</h2>
    <p><strong>French toast</strong>, also known as <em>pain perdu</em>, has its origins in Ancient Rome. The Romans used stale bread, soaking it in a mixture of milk and eggs before frying it. During the Middle Ages, European cooks repurposed day-old bread, moistening it with eggs and frying it to create this delightful dish. Today, French toast remains a beloved comfort food enjoyed worldwide.</p>
